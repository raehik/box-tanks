Design
======

This document shall show how the game is to be built from different
blocks.

As of 2015-03-09, most details are still to be figured out, and I think
rather than diving right into coding we should design the game we want
prior to writing any code.


Misc
----

  * We don't have that many people working on this repository so
    progress will be slow


Classes
-------

This is where we explain how the game will be formed from different
subsystems, which classes will form each subclasses, and the routines
that such classes should have.

  * Interface
    * InterfaceGui
    * InterfaceCli
